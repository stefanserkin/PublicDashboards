# Public Dashboards

Asphalt Green makes certain data available to customers and the public. There are a number of instances where it would be easier if dashboards could be displayed publicly. This solution makes dashboard charts available in Experience Cloud sites.

* School Adminstrators get insight into program metrics (attendance and achievements) for their particular school
* A fitness member portal offers a dashboard highlighting trends in facility visits for an individual
* A support cases dashboard is shown on a monitor and must be displayed in a non-authenticated session to avoid timeouts
* A series of charts around current pool temperature and facility conditions over time is made public
* A dashboard shows aggregate totals of program impact to support an Our Mission page
